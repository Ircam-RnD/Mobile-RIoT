# R-IoT firmware v1.8

#### note

Use this version for compatibility with [MuBu](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/mubu-en/) v1.9.2 and later.  
You can still use v1.7 with MuBu v1.9.1 and earlier.

#### quick start

* Download and install Energia version 17 from [energia.nu/download/](http://energia.nu/download/#previousreleases).
* Modify the `cc3200.ld` file and change the `HEAP_SIZE` value to `0x00007000` :
	* on Windows this file is located into `C:\Program Files(x86)\energia-0101E0017\hardware\cc3200\cores\cc3200`
    * on Mac OS, right-click on the Energia application and select "show package contents", then go to `Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/cc3200/cores/cc3200`
    * it might not be enough; in case of errors such as ``section `.heap' will not fit in region `SRAM'`` and ``region `SRAM' overflowed by 1032 bytes``, you should lower again `HEAP_SIZE`.
* Get the SLFS library from [github.com/Ircam-R-IoT/SLFS](https://github.com/Ircam-R-IoT/SLFS) and drop it into `Documents/Energia/libraries`.
* Open the `firmware.ino` file with Energia.
* Select in menu `Tools > Boards > LauchPad w/ cc3200 (80MHz)`
* Hit the "Verify" button in the upper left corner. If it builds, you're ready to upload it to the R-IoT board.
* Choose the serial port starting with `tty`
